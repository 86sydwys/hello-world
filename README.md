# hello-world

Hi Humans:

Name is 86sydwys on here. Why? I drive a limited edition number 895 of 2500 made 10 Series Scion FR-S in the world. 
It is a RWD which makes it fun to break the back end loose and slide sideways. Hence (sydwys)
Lame I know. 
I am also a a step higher than amateur photographer but definitely not a professional. 
I am learning Photoshop and am well versed in GIMP.
I have previous skills in Web Development from Edmond's Community College.
There I completed a certifiate course of Computer Science and Technology.
After completion I was hired as a paid techer's aide for the Web Development class there. 

Well that's enough about me. 
Get outside and enjoy the sun.

Respectfully,
Michael
